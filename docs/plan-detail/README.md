# Plan Details

## Overview

The `plan-detail/` directory contains detailed breakdowns of each project phase, expanding on the high-level plans in `plan/`. AI Agents should refer to these files for specific subtasks, timelines, and implementation guidance.

**Keywords:** detailed phases, subtasks, implementation steps, phase breakdown.

## Structure

- Each phase has its own file (e.g., `phase-1.md` for Phase 1 details).
- Files include:
  - Specific subtasks with descriptions.
  - Dependencies and prerequisites.
  - Expected outcomes and success criteria.

## How to Use

1. Refer to `plan/README.md` for the overall phase structure.
2. Dive into specific phase files here for detailed execution steps.
3. Cross-reference with `rules/` for guidelines and `reference/` for technical details.
