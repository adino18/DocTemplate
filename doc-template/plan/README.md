**Important:** This file is a CHECKLIST of high-level functions to be implemented. It focuses on WHAT functions will be built, not HOW to implement them. Do not add implementation details or code samples.

## Overview
**Keywords:** functions, checklist, high-level, brainstorming, requirements.

**This is a CHECKLIST of functions derived from brainstorming requirements.**

For each phase, include:
- High-level functions that need to be implemented
- Checklist format that can be marked as completed
- Focus on WHAT functions, not implementation details

**Note:** For detailed implementation steps, refer to the corresponding files in docs/plan-detail, such as phase-1.md for Phase 1.

### Phase 1: [High-level function area]
- [ ] Function 1.1: [Brief description of function to implement]
- [ ] Function 1.2: [Brief description of function to implement]
- [ ] Function 1.3: [Brief description of function to implement]

### Phase 2: [High-level function area]
- [ ] Function 2.1: [Brief description of function to implement]
- [ ] Function 2.2: [Brief description of function to implement]

### Phase 3: [High-level function area]
- [ ] Function 3.1: [Brief description of function to implement]
- [ ] Function 3.2: [Brief description of function to implement]

Add more phases if needed, e.g., Phase 4: [High-level function area]

## Guidelines for Creating This Checklist

1. **Derive from Brainstorming**: Base this checklist on the high-level concepts brainstormed from requirements
2. **Focus on Functions**: Each item should describe a function or feature, not an implementation task
3. **Keep it High-Level**: Avoid technical details, focus on what the user will see or experience
4. **Use Checklist Format**: Structure as items that can be marked as completed during implementation
5. **User-Facing Language**: Describe functions from user perspective when possible

## Example

### Phase 1: User Authentication
- [ ] Function 1.1: User registration with email verification
- [ ] Function 1.2: User login with password reset
- [ ] Function 1.3: Social media login integration

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Function 2.1: Dashboard with user statistics
- [ ] Function 2.2: Data export functionality
- [ ] Function 2.3: User profile management
